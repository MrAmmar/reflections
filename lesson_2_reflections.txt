What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	When initializing a repository , Git create hidden folder .git that contains config file ,
	object repository and other files/repositories.
	At first place , Git will have no commits , running the "git log" commande will throw an error.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is an intermediate between WorkingPlace and Repository 
	when i chose wat files to track , they moved to the stagine area ,then I can create a commit
	based on that last one.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	Committing procedure go through three stages :
	- Making changes in the Working Directory (WD)
	- Adding those changes to the Staging Area (SA)
	- Firing a commit (changes added to the Repository (R))
	When i make a change and it seems like a logical one that deserves a commit 
	then i move it to the SA using this command :
			git add changedfile.format
	Making sure that the SA contains my target changedfile by comparing
	my WD and SA using this command :
			git diff --staged
	and finally committing my change (moving from SA to R)

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

	Working on a project , at some points i may want to make some radical changes,
	like chang the language , or trying some new features that my change the project's concept
	or creating a backup . That's were branches can be useful 
	to keep the work tracked and well organized.
